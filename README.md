How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
 
 The most important skill needed to properly interpret the users needs is to listen to them and not be trying to plan ahead or think about what needs to be done later but just listening to them when they are telling you what they need.  Once they have told you everything then if anything needs clarification or additional information then you can ask the followup questions needed to get that information.  Now that you have the information that is needed creating the user stories is much simpler because you have as much detail as possible on what the user needs.
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
 
  The first step that I would take in developing programs would be to go over the requirements to ensure that I fully understand what I am going to be developing.  Once I fully understand what needs to be done I would see if I could break the program down into smaller functioning parts so each part could be developed and tested on its own to help reduce the time it would take to troubleshoot any problems that may occur during the development process.  Once each part has been fully developed and tested I would then put all of the parts together and work on the final product.  I would incorporate the entire agile process into my future development work.  After working with that process in this class I find it to be much more flexible and efficient than other processes.
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  One of the biggest traits of a good team member is the ability to have a productive converstation with other members of your team and the ability to compromise.  With the vast array of personalities and opinions in the world it is extreamly unlikely that everyone on the team will always agree with how things should be done.  So the ability to have a productive converstation with your team members where everyone gets to tell thier opinion on how or why things should be done a certian way and then everyone come together with all of that information and come to a compromised agreement so the team can work together towards the same goal.
